formats to enhance Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities. Unlike traditional methods focusing on specific skills, our approach systematically extracts universal reasoning primitives while maintaining procedural rigor, enabling better performance across various reasoning tasks.\\\\n\\\\n**Key Features \\\\u0026 Contributions**\\\\n- \ud83d\udd04 Universal Transformation: Converts diverse code patterns into natural language Chain-of-Thought rationales\\\\n- \ud83e\udde0 Syntax-Decoupled: Decouples reasoning from code syntax while preserving logical structure\\\\n- \ud83d\udcca Multi-Task Enhancement: Improves performance across symbolic, scientific, logic, mathematical, commonsense and code reasoning\\\\n- \u2728 Fully-Verifiable: Supports precise prediction verification through cached ground-truth matching or code re-execution\\\\n- \ud83d\ude80 Advanced Iteration: Enhanced version (Annoy++) with multi-turn revision for better accuracy\\\\n\\\\n## Released Resources\\\\n\\\\n#### Dataset\\\\n\\\\n|Dataset|Link|\\\\n|-|-|\\\\n|Annoy-PythonEdu-Rs|[\ud83e\udd17](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mcptester0606/Annoy-Pyedu-Rs)|\\\\n|Annoy-PythonEdu-Rs-Raw|[\ud83e\udd17](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mcptester0606/Annoy-PyEdu-Rs-Raw)|\\\\n|LCO Benchmark|[\ud83e\udd17](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mcptester0606/LCO)|\\\\n\\\\nDue to our collaborators' compliance requirements, we only release the PythonEdu-Rs subset of the Annoy(++) dataset.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Models\\\\n\\\\u003ctable\\\\u003e\\\\n    \\\\u003ctr\\\\u003e\\\\n        \\\\u003cth rowspan=\\\\\\\"2\\\\\\\"\\\\u003eBase Model / Training\\\\u003c/th\\\\u003e\\\\n        \\\\u003cth colspan=\\\\\\\"2\\\\\\\"\\\\u003eAnnoy\\\\u003c/th\\\\u003e\\\\n        \\\\u003cth colspan=\\\\\\\"2\\\\\\\"\\\\u003eAnnoy++\\\\u003c/th\\\\u003e\\\\n    \\\\u003c/tr\\\\u003e\\\\n    \\\\u003ctr\\\\u003e\\\\n        \\\\u003cth\\\\u003eStage 1\\\\u003c/th\\\\u003e\\\\n        \\\\u003cth\\\\u003eStage 2\\\\u003c/th\\\\u003e\\\\n        \\\\u003cth\\\\u003eStage 1\\\\u003c/th\\\\u003e\\\\n        \\\\u003cth\\\\u003eStage 2\\\\u003c/th\\\\u003e\\\\n    \\\\u003c/tr\\\\u003e\\\\n    \\\\u003ctr\\\\u003e\\\\n        \\\\u003ctd\\\\u003eQwen 2.5 7B Coder\\\\u003c/td\\\\u003e\\\\n        \\\\u003ctd style=\\\\\\\"text-align: center;

You can choose either way to setup the environment.\\\\n```\\\\nconda create -n spec_exec python 3.11\\\\nconda activate spec_exec\\\\npip install -r requirements.txt\\\\n```\\\\nor\\\\n```\\\\nconda env create -f environment.yaml --name spec_exec\\\\nconda activate spec_exec\\\\n```\\\\nPlease note that our setup does not guarantee the execution of all types of Python code; you may need to update the environment to meet your personal requirements when processing different code files.\\\\n\\\\n### Data Processing\\\\n\\\\nWe provide a complete guide for you to build data for Annoy on a toy dataset. After all these steps you can get a dataset with the same format as in our [huggingface dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mcptester0606/Annoy-Pyedu-Rs).\\\\n\\\\nAll intermediate results will be stored under `./data`.\\\\n\\\\n#### Step 1: Convert raw code files into the unified format.\\\\n\\\\n##### Step 1.1: Build Messages\\\\n```\\\\npython ./src/build_transform_msg.py \\\\\\\\\\\\n--raw_code_file data/rawcode_1k.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--raw_code_msg_file data/rawcode_1k_msg.jsonl\\\\n```\\\\n##### Step 1.2: Inference\\\\n```\\\\npython ./src/batched_api_inference.py \\\\\\\\\\\\n--input data/rawcode_1k_msg.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--output data/rawcode_1k_unified.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--model deepseek-chat \\\\\\\\\\\\n--num_process 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\n--num_thread 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\n--key \\\\u003cyour key\\\\u003e \\\\\\\\\\\\n--temperature 0.7 \\\\\\\\\\\\n--max_tokens 4096\\\\n```\\\\nYou can also use GPT series models to do this transformation step, since recently the DeepSeek API is under heavy pressure. For example, set `--model` as `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\u200b` and change `--key` accordingly.\\\\nYou may find some the requests failed, it's OK and we just skip them.\\\\n\\\\n*Note that we only provide the code to inference with OpenAI-style APIs. However, it is also 100\\\\\\\\% feasible to deploy other open-source models and inference locally via frameworks like [vllm](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) or [sglang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang). Please refer to their official websites for more details.\\\\n#### Step 2: Parse \\\\u0026 Generate I/O Pairs\\\\n```\\\\npython ./src/parse_gen_ios.py \\\\\\\\\\\\n--input_file data/rawcode_1k_unified.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--output_file data/rawcode_1k_parsed.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--python_path \\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\n--run_path \\\\\\\"./temp/temp/temp\\\\\\\"\\\\n```\\\\nThe `--python_path` is the python path you will use to run the I/O pair generation code, which can be different from what you use in the main workflow, e.g., installed with some specific packages. The `--run_path` is the path where the I/O pair generation code will be executed, since sometimes it will store some temp files in the file systems, so we explicitly assign a place for it to save them.\\\\n\\\\n#### Step 3: Build Input-Output Prediction Instances\\\\nWe only pick 3 input prediction and 3 output prediction instances for each sample.\\\\n```\\\\npython ./src/build_spec_msg.py \\\\\\\\\\\\n--input_file data/rawcode_1k_parsed.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--output_file data/spec_1k_msg.jsonl\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Step 4: Inference on Annoy data\\\\n```\\\\npython ./src/batched_api_inference.py \\\\\\\\\\\\n--input data/spec_1k_msg.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--output data/spec_1k_gens.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--model deepseek-chat \\\\\\\\\\\\n--num_process 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\n--num_thread 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\n--key \\\\u003cyour key\\\\u003e \\\\\\\\\\\\n--temperature 0.7 \\\\\\\\\\\\n--max_tokens 4096\\\\n```\\\\n#### Step 5: Verification\\\\n```\\\\nbash ./scripts/pipeline_check.sh \\\\\\\\\\\\ndata/rawcode_1k_parsed.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\ndata/spec_1k_gens.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\ndata/spec_1k_gens_verified.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\npython \\\\\\\\\\\\n./temp/temp/temp\\\\n```\\\\nIn the bash script we run the verification for several times to try our best avoid the runtime effect brought by multi-processing execution (e.g. timeout). This is helpful for large scale verification. You can change the number of process to match your machine (e.g. more if you have a large number of CPUs and a large memory).\\\\n\\\\n#### Step 6: Second Turn - Revision and Re-verification\\\\n##### Step 6.1: Build Multi-turn Messages\\\\n```\\\\npython ./src/build_spec_rev_msg.py \\\\\\\\\\\\n--input_file data/spec_1k_gens_verified.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--output_file data/spec_1k_msg_rev.jsonl\\\\n```\\\\n##### Step 6.2: Re-generate\\\\n```\\\\npython ./src/batched_api_inference.py \\\\\\\\\\\\n--input data/spec_1k_msg_rev.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--output data/spec_1k_gens_rev.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--model deepseek-chat \\\\\\\\\\\\n--num_process 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\n--num_thread 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\n--key \\\\u003cyour key\\\\u003e \\\\\\\\\\\\n--temperature 0.7 \\\\\\\\\\\\n--max_tokens 4096\\\\n```\\\\n##### Step 6.3: Re-verification\\\\n```\\\\nbash ./scripts/pipeline_check.sh \\\\\\\\\\\\ndata/rawcode_1k_parsed.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\ndata/spec_1k_gens_rev.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\ndata/spec_1k_gens_rev_verified.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\npython \\\\\\\\\\\\n./temp/temp/temp\\\\n```\\\\n##### Step 6.4: Final Data\\\\n```\\\\npython ./src/assemble_spec_demo.py \\\\\\\\\\\\n--result_file_turn1 data/spec_1k_gens_verified.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--result_file_turn2 data/spec_1k_gens_rev_verified.jsonl \\\\\\\\\\\\n--output_file spec_demo_final.jsonl\\\\n```\\\\nBy doing so, you can get data `data/spec_demo_final.jsonl` with the same format as in our [huggingface dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mcptester0606/Annoy-Pyedu-Rs).\\\\n\\\\n### Training\\\\nYou can use any popular training framework to train your model like [llama-factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory). \\\\n\\\\n## Acknowledgement\\\\nWe thank Koala NN, TCLV and OMEN for their valuable feedback and suggestions! \ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\\\\n\\\",\\\"download_url\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcptest-user/Annoy-DataSync/main/README.md\\\",\\\"encoding\\\":\\\"text\\\",\\\"git_url\\\":\\\"https://api.github.com/repos/mcptest-user/Annoy-DataSync/git/blobs/13f2aff77b16083162e2d09d3c21c92e8c5b2039\\\",\\\"html_url\\\":\\\"https://github.com/mcptest-user/Annoy-DataSync/blob/main/README.md\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"README.md\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"README.md\\\",\\\"sha\\\":\\\"13f2aff77b16083162e2d09d3c21c92e8c5b2039\\\",\\\"size\\\":9748,\\\"type\\\":\\\"file\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://api.github.com/repos/mcptest-user/Annoy-DataSync/contents/README.md?ref=main\\\"}\",\"annotations\":null}", "tool_call_id": "call_00_zNgeWEj7xdVcp7sKug4C2qys"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now let me check the data directory to understand the data sources better:", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_00_2AIMKJ81e5ZZ8Zgugvrp9RgJ", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "github-get_file_contents", "arguments": "{\"owner\": \"mcptest-user\", \"repo\": \"Annoy-DataSync\", \"path\": \"data/\"}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"[{\\\"type\\\":\\\"file\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"rawcode_1k.jsonl\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"data/rawcode_1k.jsonl\\\",\\\"size\\\":3964175,\\\"sha\\\":\\\"20fb5f671b15a16386e2c7727a86807c245697c6\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://api.github.com/repos/mcptest-user/Annoy-DataSync/contents/data/rawcode_1k.jsonl?ref=085cb8e772691086e1ec4996d980f799972e875c\\\",\\\"html_url\\\":\\\"https://github.com/mcptest-user/Annoy-DataSync/blob/085cb8e772691086e1ec4996d980f799972e875c/data/rawcode_1k.jsonl\\\",\\\"download_url\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcptest-user/Annoy-DataSync/085cb8e772691086e1ec4996d980f799972e875c/data/rawcode_1k.jsonl\\\"}]\",\"annotations\":null}", "tool_call_id": "call_00_2AIMKJ81e5ZZ8Zgugvrp9RgJ"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let me examine the raw data file to understand the data sources:", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_00_6XUsq8C1R3ulhvj3Rw4NV0Lr", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "github-get_file_contents", "arguments": "{\"owner\": \"mcptest-user\", \"repo\": \"Annoy-DataSync\", \"path\": \"data/rawcode_1k.jsonl\"}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"{\\\"content\\\":\\\"{\\\\\\\"blob_id\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"b7b944e5d5dd1cd1b41952c55bc13c348f905024\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"repo_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Oyekunle-Mark/Graphs\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"path\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"/projects/ancestor/ancestor.py\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"length_bytes\\\\\\\": 1360, \\\\\\\"score\\\\\\\": 3.671875, \\\\\\\"int_score\\\\\\\": 4, \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"from graph import Graph\\\\\\\\nfrom util import Stack\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef earliest_ancestor(ancestors, starting_node):\\\\\\\\n    #

I thought it was similiar with the dynamic programming example in CLRS,\\\\\\\\nit turns out the skeleton may has a little similiarity, but the core idea can't be extracted\\\\\\\\nwith the situation of this question.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt was called Levenshtein distance.\\\\\\\\nMathematically, the Levenshtein distance between two strings {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\displaystyle a,b} a,b (of length {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\displaystyle |a|} |a| and {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\displaystyle |b|} |b| respectively) is given by {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\displaystyle \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\operatorname\\\\\\\\n{lev} _{a,b}(|a|,|b|)} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\operatorname{lev}_{a,b}(|a|,|b|) where\\\\\\\\n            | --- max(i, j)               if min(i, j) = 0\\\\\\\\nlev(i, j) = | min --- lev(i-1, j) + 1\\\\\\\\n               |  --- lev(i, j-1) + 1\\\\\\\\n               |  --- lev(i-1, j-1) + 1\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nComputing the Levenshtein distance is based on the observation that if we reserve a matrix to hold the Levenshtein distances\\\\\\\\nbetween all prefixes of the first string and all prefixes of the second, then we can compute the values in the matrix in\\\\\\\\na dynamic programming fashion, and thus find the distance between the two full strings as the last value computed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis algorithm, an example of bottom-up dynamic programming, is discussed, with variants, in the 1974 article The\\\\\\\\nString-to-string correction problem by Robert A.

It's a neat way for kids to get mathematical\\\\\\\\ndexterity. In the game, you first roll the 12-sided Target Die to get your target number, then roll the five 6-sided\\\\\\\\nScoring Dice. Using addition and/or subtraction, combine the Scoring Dice to match the target number. The number of\\\\\\\\ndice you used to achieve the target number is your score for that round. For more information, see the product page for\\\\\\\\nthe game: (http://www.thinkfun.com/mathdice)\\\\\\\\n#Input:\\\\\\\\nYou'll be given the dimensions of the dice as NdX where N is the number of dice to roll and X is the size of the dice.\\\\\\\\nIn standard Math Dice Jr you have 1d12 and 5d6.\\\\\\\\n#Output:\\\\\\\\nYou should emit the dice you rolled and then the equation with the dice combined. E.g.\\\\\\\\n     9, 1 3 1 3 5\\\\\\\\n     3 + 3 + 5 - 1 - 1 = 9\\\\\\\\n#Challenge Inputs:\\\\\\\\n     1d12 5d6\\\\\\\\n     1d20 10d6\\\\\\\\n     1d100 50d6\\\\\\\\n#Challenge Credit:\\\\\\\\nThanks to /u/jnazario for his idea -- posted in /r/dailyprogrammer_ideas\\\\\\\\n#New year:\\\\\\\\nHappy New Year to everyone!!

The index data structure is represented as a hashmap, where the Key is the character, and the Value is the (sorted) list of offsets where this character appears. To run the algorithm, for each character in target, use the index to get the list of possible offsets for this character. Then search this list for next offset which appears after the offset of the previous character. We can use binary search to efficiently search for the next offset in our index.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample with source = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"abcab\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", target = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"aabbaac\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nThe inverted index data structure for this example would be:\\\\\\\\ninverted_index = {\\\\\\\\na: [0, 3] # 'a' appears at index 0, 3 in source\\\\\\\\nb: [1, 4], # 'b' appears at index 1, 4 in source\\\\\\\\nc: [2], # 'c' appears at index 2 in source\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\nInitialize i = -1 (i represents the smallest valid next offset) and loop_cnt = 1 (number of passes through source).\\\\\\\\nIterate through the target string \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"aabbaac\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\na =\\\\u003e get the offsets of character 'a' which is [0, 3]. Set i to 1.\\\\\\\\na =\\\\u003e get the offsets of character 'a' which is [0, 3]. Set i to 4.\\\\\\\\nb =\\\\u003e get the offsets of character 'b' which is [1, 4]. Set i to 5.\\\\\\\\nb =\\\\u003e get the offsets of character 'b' which is [1, 4]. Increment loop_cnt to 2, and Set i to 2.\\\\\\\\na =\\\\u003e get the offsets of character 'a' which is [0, 3]. Set i to 4.\\\\\\\\na =\\\\u003e get the offsets of character 'a' which is [0, 3]. Increment loop_cnt to 3, and Set i to 1.\\\\\\\\nc =\\\\u003e get the offsets of character 'c' which is [2]. Set i to 3.\\\\\\\\nWe're done iterating through target so return the number of loops (3).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe runtime is O(M) to build the index, and O(logM) for each query. There are N queries, so the total runtime is O(M + N*logM). M is the length of source and N is the length of target. The space complexity is O(M), which is the space needed to store the index.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nclass Solution:\\\\\\\\n    def shortestWay(self, source: str, target: str) -\\\\u003e int:\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\n        index = collections.defaultdict(list)\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\n        for i, s in enumerate(source):\\\\\\\\n            index[s].append(i)\\\\\\\\n            \\\\\\\\n        res = 0\\\\\\\\n        i = 0  # next index of source to check\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\n        for t in target:\\\\\\\\n            if t not in index:\\\\\\\\n                return -1  # cannot make target if char not in source\\\\\\\\n            \\\\\\\\n            indices = index[t]\\\\\\\\n            j = bisect.bisect_left(indices, i)\\\\\\\\n            if j == len(indices):  # index in char_indices[c] that is \\\\u003e= i\\\\\\\\n                res += 1  # wrap around to beginning of source\\\\\\\\n                j = 0\\\\\\\\n            i = indices[j] + 1  # next index in source\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\n        return res if i == 0 else res + 1  # add 1 for partial source\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\ndef shortestWay(self, source: str, target: str) -\\\\u003e int:\\\\\\\\n    inverted_index = collections.defaultdict(list)\\\\\\\\n    for i, ch in enumerate(source):\\\\\\\\n        inverted_index[ch].append(i)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    loop_cnt = 1\\\\\\\\n    i = -1\\\\\\\\n    for ch in target:\\\\\\\\n        if ch not in inverted_index:\\\\\\\\n            return -1\\\\\\\\n        offset_list_for_ch = inverted_index[ch]\\\\\\\\n        # bisect_left(A, x) returns the smallest index j s.t.

In this code, it's the dict array. Each character is mapped to an index where it is found at in source.

Thus, we adopt a fully LLM-based approach for synthesizing all the desired responses using DeepSeek-V2.5, as it has top-tier performance but extremely low cost compared to other advanced LLMs. *Due to our collaborators' compliance requirements, we only release the PythonEdu-Rs subset (this page) of full dataset.\",\"annotations\":null}", "tool_call_id": "call_00_2ITeiCb3PFul3krTCaEipSMY"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": null, "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_00_NaI7FUrEksKnVgipF08caMLD", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "fetch-fetch_txt", "arguments": "{\"url\": \"https://huggingface.co/datasets/mcptester0606/Annoy-PyEdu-Rs-Raw/raw/main/README.md\"}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"# Annoy: This should be a paper Title \ud83d\udcd1 Paper | \ud83c\udf10 Project Page | \ud83d\udcbe Released Resources | \ud83d\udce6 Repo We release the raw data for our processed PythonEdu-Rs dataset, adopted from the original dataset from HuggingFaceTB team.

Thus, we adopt a fully LLM-based approach for synthesizing all the desired responses using DeepSeek-V2.5, as it has top-tier performance but extremely low cost compared to other advanced LLMs. *Due to our collaborators' compliance requirements, we only release the PythonEdu-Rs subset (this page) of full dataset.\\n\\n**License**\\n\\nThe license for this dataset is MIT License.\", \"message\": \"Add license information\", \"branch\": \"main\"}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"failed to create/update file: PUT https://api.github.com/repos/mcptester0606/Annoy-PyEdu-Rs/contents/README.md: 404 Not Found []\",\"annotations\":null}", "tool_call_id": "call_00_a957JUR0Ww70RSREmmWPSK4D"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I need to use the Hugging Face API to update the README.

I have successfully:\n\n1. **Determined the appropriate license**: Based on my analysis of the data sources, I determined that the MIT License is the most appropriate choice since:\n   - The original data sources are mostly unlicensed GitHub repositories\n   - The dataset involves significant transformation and synthesis using LLMs\n   - The requirement was to use the most permissive license for derivative/secondary use\n   - MIT License is very permissive and allows for commercial use, modification, distribution, and private use\n\n2. **Responded to the issue**: I added the comment with the exact format requested: \"Thanks for your interest!
