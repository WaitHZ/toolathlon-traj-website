Then, submit the missing assignments on canvas.\n\nYou only need to submit the assignments that are missing \u2014 no need to take action on those that are already submitted.\n\nAlso, I want to mention that I was officially excused from Assignment 2 due to a leave of absence. I informed the instructor at the time the assignment was given. The formal leave document is saved somewhere in my workspace, but the TA seems to have forgotten about it.\n\nAfter submitting the required assignments, please also:\nLocate the leave document.\nSend an email to the TA to remind them about my approved leave for Assignment 2.\nAttach the leave document in the email.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll help you with this task.

This theme is masterfully woven throughout the entire narrative and serves as the emotional and philosophical backbone of the film.\\n\\n### Detailed Analysis:\\n\\n#### 1. Hope as a Driving Force\\n- **Andy Dufresne's Unwavering Hope**: Despite being wrongfully convicted and sentenced to life in prison, Andy never loses hope. His hope is not naive optimism but a deep, resilient belief in the possibility of change and freedom.\\n- **Red's Journey from Despair to Hope**: Red initially represents the institutionalized prisoner who has lost all hope, but through his friendship with Andy, he gradually rediscovers hope and the possibility of redemption.\\n\\n#### 2. Redemption Through Action\\n- **Andy's Redemption**: Andy achieves redemption not through escape alone, but through his actions within the prison system - helping other inmates, improving the library, and maintaining his dignity and humanity.\\n- **Red's Redemption**: Red's redemption comes through his transformation from a cynical, hopeless man to someone who can believe in hope again and make the choice to \\\"get busy living.\\\"\\n\\n#### 3. The Power of Perseverance\\n- **The 19-Year Escape Plan**: Andy's methodical, patient approach to his escape represents the theme of hope through perseverance. He never gave up, even when faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles.\\n- **The Rock Hammer and Rita Hayworth**: These symbols represent the small acts of hope and resistance that Andy maintained throughout his imprisonment.\\n\\n#### 4. Institutional vs. Personal Redemption\\n- **The Shawshank Prison System**: The film critiques the dehumanizing nature of the prison system while showing that personal redemption is possible even within such an environment.\\n- **Individual Transformation**: Each character's journey toward redemption is personal and internal, not dependent on the system's recognition.\\n\\n#### 5. The Message of Hope\\nThe film's most powerful message is that hope is not just an emotion but a choice and an action. As Andy tells Red: \\\"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.\\\"\\n\\n### Conclusion:\\n\\\"The Shawshank Redemption\\\" teaches us that hope and redemption are not passive states but active choices that require courage, perseverance, and faith in the possibility of change. The film's enduring appeal lies in its universal message that even in the darkest circumstances, hope can prevail and redemption is always possible for those who choose to pursue it.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Student ID**: 12345  \\n**Name**: John Doe  \\n**Course**: FILM101  \\n**Assignment**: 1 - Classic Film Analysis  \\n**Date**: January 15, 2025\\n\\n\\n---\\n/workspace/dumps/workspace/homeworks/mine/Film_History_Answer.md:\\n# Assignment 2: Film History and Evolution - Answer\\n\\n\\nAuthor: Zachary Edwards\\nEmail: zedwards@mcp.com\\nID: 2201210606\\n\\n## Question: Who is considered the pioneer of modern filmmaking techniques?\\n\\n### Answer:\\n\\n**D.W.
