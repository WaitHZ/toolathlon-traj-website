Having\\\\nvalidated these measurements against theoretical predictions and thoroughly\\\\nexamined for potential systematic biases, we have found that the impact of\\\\nsource galaxy clustering and reduced shear on the i3PCF is negligible for\\\\nStage-III surveys. Furthermore, we have tested the Gaussianity assumption for\\\\nthe likelihood of our data vector and found that while the sampling\\\\ndistribution of the 2PCF can be well approximated by a Gaussian function, the\\\\nlikelihood of the combined 2PCF + i3PCF data vector including filter sizes of\\\\n$90'$ and larger can deviate from this assumption. Our SBI pipeline employs\\\\nmasked autoregressive flows to perform neural likelihood estimation and is\\\\nvalidated to give statistically accurate posterior estimates. On mock data, we\\\\nfind that including the i3PCF yields a substantial $63.8\\\\\\\\%$ median improvement\\\\nin the figure of merit for $\\\\\\\\Omega_m - \\\\\\\\sigma_8 - w_0$. These findings are\\\\nconsistent with previous works on the i3PCF and demonstrate that our SBI\\\\nframework can achieve the accuracy and realism needed to analyse the i3PCF in\\\\nwide-area weak lensing surveys.\\\",\\n      \\\"categories\\\": [\\n        \\\"astro-ph.CO\\\"\\n      ],\\n      \\\"published\\\": \\\"2025-10-15T17:59:25+00:00\\\",\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13805v1\\\",\\n      \\\"resource_uri\\\": \\\"arxiv://2510.13805v1\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"id\\\": \\\"2510.13804v1\\\",\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Generative Universal Verifier as Multimodal Meta-Reasoner\\\",\\n      \\\"authors\\\": [\\n        \\\"Xinchen Zhang\\\",\\n        \\\"Xiaoying Zhang\\\",\\n        \\\"Youbin Wu\\\",\\n        \\\"Yanbin Cao\\\",\\n        \\\"Renrui Zhang\\\",\\n        \\\"Ruihang Chu\\\",\\n        \\\"Ling Yang\\\",\\n        \\\"Yujiu Yang\\\"\\n      ],\\n      \\\"abstract\\\": \\\"We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin\\\\ndesigned for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and\\\\nunified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection\\\\nand refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process.\\\\nThis work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a\\\\ncomprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating\\\\nvisual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs\\\\nconsistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap\\\\nfrom human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two\\\\nautomated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train\\\\nOmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for\\\\nuniversal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3).\\\\nThrough training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification\\\\nand demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We\\\\npropose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that\\\\nleverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within\\\\nunified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through\\\\niterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal\\\\nverifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios.\\\\nEmpirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7),\\\\nand GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods,\\\\nsuch as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual\\\\nverification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation\\\\nand scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and\\\\ncontrollable next-generation reasoning systems.\\\",\\n      \\\"categories\\\": [\\n        \\\"cs.CV\\\",\\n        \\\"cs.AI\\\",\\n        \\\"cs.CL\\\"\\n      ],\\n      \\\"published\\\": \\\"2025-10-15T17:59:24+00:00\\\",\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13804v1\\\",\\n      \\\"resource_uri\\\": \\\"arxiv://2510.13804v1\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"id\\\": \\\"2510.13803v1\\\",\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Density reconstruction from biased tracers: Testing the equivalence principle through consistency relations\\\",\\n      \\\"authors\\\": [\\n        \\\"Lawrence Dam\\\",\\n        \\\"Omar Darwish\\\"\\n      ],\\n      \\\"abstract\\\": \\\"Consistency relations of large-scale structure offer a unique and powerful\\\\ntest of the weak equivalence principle (EP) on cosmological scales.
